This abstraction simplifies device driver development and allows multiple drivers to share the same I/O address space without conflicts.  A GART, on the other hand, is a specific type of memory mapping technique used in graphics hardware to improve the performance of GPU virtual addressing. It allows the GPU to access video memory using virtual addresses while the system maps those virtual addresses to physical addresses in the video memory. This can help reduce the amount of data that needs to be copied between the CPU and GPU, improving overall graphics performance.

One common date is 1520, when King Christian II of Denmark invaded Sweden and was defeated by Sten Sture the Younger at the Battle of Brunkeberg. After this victory, Sten Sture became the Regent of Sweden, and he began to build a Swedish fleet to protect the country from future invasions. This marked the beginning of organized naval forces in Sweden.  Another date that is often cited as the founding of the Swedish Navy is 1536, when Gustav Vasa led a rebellion against the Danish rule and became the King of Sweden. Gustav Vasa is considered the founder of the modern Swedish state, and he established a strong navy to defend Sweden's coastline and trade routes.  Therefore, both Sten Sture's efforts in the early 16th century and Gustav Vasa's establishment of a more formal navy in the mid-16th century can be seen as important milestones in the history of the Swedish Navy.
